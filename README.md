**Contribution and Credit**
- Kevin Long (Instructor): Very helpful and patient with students throughout the entire Capstone. Increased my understanding of code overall. Although I was struggling with javascript Kevins example walkthrough of the project gave me the confidence i needed t try it on my own and better understand javascript.

**My Point of View**
In the beggining I was still trying to grasp the concept of javascript, I am a lot more comfortable with javascript after this capstone and the past few weeks of practice with it. There is a lot more i want to do with my project, unfortuneatley I caught a cold in the same week so I prioritized meeting the requirements of this project. I will be further improving EnjoyTheoutdoors project as soon as i am well recovered.
